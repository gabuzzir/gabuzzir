- 👋 Hi, I’m @gabuzzir
- 👀 I’m interested in developing tools for creative output and making small games like little jewelboxes
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming via CS50x
- 💞️ I'm working on my skills and knowledge before I would be ready to collaborate, unless you need an artist that is, then drop me a line!
- 📫 You can reach me by dropping me a message here
